# service-nexus
 tfw no money so you fuse your apis and other services into this


## Todos:
- [ ] instead of fetching a random name just pick randomly from a list of names (make a random-name crate)
- [ ] maybe optimize /cats/random to do some fetches at the same time

- [ ] double check how to clone ClientWithKeys in an Arc-y way

- [ ] clean up the supabase struct
